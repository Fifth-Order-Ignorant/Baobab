## Project Objective

Build a hybrid e-learning and entrepreneur community platform that provides an all-in-one start-up creation experience for aspiring African entrepreneurs. The platform provides support for discussions in the community, learning from mentors, and for the mentors to pass on their knowledge.


## Key Personas


### Persona 1: Eidi Obiero

Eidi — a 23 year old aspiring entrepreneur, who plans on improving the lives of daily Kenyans by installing a cost-efficient magnetic rail system. She plans on using new advances in nano-materials to build a system that is not only cheap and durable, but during the construction will not disturb the citizens who live around the construction sites.


### Persona 2: Harold Silvia

Harold — a 65 year old founder of a top social media platform, who desires to spread his wealth of knowledge to future entrepreneurs, regardless of location, age, or other handicaps. He wishes to be able to interact with those he teaches, to get a more personal connection with them, and also use interactive components to give hands-on experience as well.


### Persona 3: Rahul Sharma

Rahul — a 30 year old investment broker, who would like to make more informed decisions before investing in tech startups, such as being able to do a check on their plans. He would like a centralized location to find this information.


## Key Scenarios


### Scenario 1: Learning

Eidi has a concrete plan and design for her magnetic rail system, however, she is unsure how to turn this solution into a company, how to get investors, and how to grow the company. She needs to learn how to get a company started, and how to grow and scale her product.


### Scenario 2: Networking

Eidi is having trouble realizing her design out into blueprints and concrete plans. She needs to learn some tools that will help her create plans. She also needs to meet some others who can help her realize her vision.


### Scenario 3: Teaching

Harold has created an entire lesson plan (with drawings and documents) for an in-person lecture about marketing to investors. He needs to be guided on how to digitize this into an online lesson that can be taught to any person.


## Key Principles


### Principle 1: Depth First

Prioritize quality over quantity. The design should have fully-fleshed out services for a stellar user experience on what features we have for the product, over having more services with less capabilities.


### Principle 2: Entrepreneur First

Entrepreneur-centric usability over all else. The design should prioritize how useful the platform is to young entrepreneurs over the usefulness to other users, such as investors or mentors.
