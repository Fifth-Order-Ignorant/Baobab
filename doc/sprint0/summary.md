## Project Objective

Build a hybrid e-learning and entrepreneur community platform that provides an all-in-one start-up creation experience for aspiring African entrepreneurs. The platform provides support for discussions in the community, learning from mentors, and for the mentors to pass on their knowledge.


## Key Personas


### Persona 1: Eidi Obiero

Eidi — a 23 year old aspiring entrepreneur, who plans on improving the lives of daily Kenyans by installing a cost-efficient magnetic rail system. She plans on using new advances in nano-materials to build a system that is not only cheap and durable, but during the construction will not disturb the citizens who live around the construction sites.


### Persona 2: Harold Silvia

Harold — a 65 year old founder of a top social media platform, who desires to spread his wealth of knowledge to future entrepreneurs, regardless of location, age, or other handicaps. He wishes to be able to interact with those he teaches, to get a more personal connection with them, and also use interactive components to give hands-on experience as well.


### Persona 3: Rahul Sharma

Rahul — a 30 year old investment broker, who would like to make more informed decisions before investing in tech startups, such as being able to do a check on their plans. He would like a centralized location to find this information.


## Key Scenarios


### Scenario 1: Learning

Eidi has discovered that her magnetic rail system will require several different raw materials to manufacture, and also require many different tools to create each part. She needs to learn how to source the materials, finance this cost, and also manufacture the materials.


### Scenario 2: Networking

Eidi is having trouble realizing her design out into blueprints and concrete plans. She needs to learn some tools that will help her create plans. She also needs to meet some others who can help her realize her vision.


### Scenario 3: Teaching

Harold has created an entire lesson plan (with drawings and documents) for an in-person lecture about marketing to investors. He needs to be guided on how to digitize this into an online lesson that can be taught to any person.


## Key Principles


### Principle 1: Minimalism

Minimalism, over codebase size, first and foremost. The design should not be cluttered, but stream-lined, so if views can be consolidated, we will consolidate them. In general, the learning curve for using the application itself should be relatively small.


### Principle 2: Entrepreneur First

Entrepreneur-centric usability over all else. The design should prioritize how useful the platform is to young entrepreneurs over the usefulness to other users, such as investors or mentors.
