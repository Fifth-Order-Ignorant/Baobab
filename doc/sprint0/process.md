# Process



### Team Organization

- How did you organize the team? Which tools did you use, if any?

We used multiple Google Docs to keep track of everything we did for Sprint 0. To divide tasks between us equally, we held a group meeting on Discord which went on for about two hours. We went through the deliverables and decided on who would primarily work on which task.

| Task            | Assignee(s)     | Deadline for Assignee(s) | Proofreader(s)    |
| --------------- | --------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- |
| User Experience | Ethan, Hai Yang | May 27                   | Akira             |
| Product Backlog | Michael         | May 26                   | Maryam            |
| Done            | Michael         | May 26                   | Akira             |
| README          | Hai Yang        | May 26                   | Ethan, Akira      |
| Summary         | Akira           | May 24                   | Jan               |
| Competition     | Catherine       | May 23                   | Maryam            |
| Personas        | Jan             | May 26                   | Catherine, Maryam |
| Process         | Maryam          | May 28                   | Michael           |

We set a self-imposed deadline to make sure there is enough time to polish up last minute changes that come up.

### Decision Making

- How did you make decisions?

Dividing tasks between ourselves:
We held a meeting and discussed the deliverables. There were several volunteers for each task, so no problems came up in that regard.

Making decisions on the project:
We discussed options on Discord as they came up and weighed the pros and cons of each alternative. If we couldn't reach a quick conclusion through text, we would hold a meeting or ask the instruction team and the product owner.

We keep track of all the decisions we have made through several documents on Google Docs.

### Prioritizing User Stories

- How did you define priority and/or points of user stories?
- How many rounds of voting (on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?

### Meetings

- How frequently did you meet?

We held big group meetings 1-2 times per week to talk about the project and Sprint 0. We held smaller group meetings (between people whose tasks were more related) as discussions came up. We also held meetings where we simply worked on Sprint 0 together.

### Next Phase

- What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?

We noticed that communication with the product owner is very important and helpful in making decisions for the project, especially user stories. This is something we'd like to continue to do as the project moves forward.

We would also like to continue holding small group meetings frequently, as they are beneficial for producing high-quality work and keeping motivation up.

While working on the deliverables for Sprint 0, we also realized the importance of clear communication and keeping track of the process and decisions that we make. We intend to make better notes in our big group meetings in order to work towards that goal.
