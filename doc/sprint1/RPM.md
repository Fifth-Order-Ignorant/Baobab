# Release Planning Meeting 

**Release Date**: August 11

**Release Goals**: The release goals will be completed throughout the 4 sprints. In each sprint we will complete 5 user stories from the [product backlog](https://github.com/UTSCCSCC01/project-fifth-order-ignorant/blob/main/doc/sprint0/PB.md). Completing the user stories will accomplish the following goals:



*   A functional website which provides appropriate abilities for participants, organizations, and admins.  
*   A platform where participants can watch information to learn how to start their own business.
*   A platform where people can discuss information that they’ve learned with their peers.
*   A platform where people can network/connect with others on the platform.
*   A platform with clean, readable, well-documented, and tested code.

**Project Scope**:



*   Responsive website: Works well on desktop and mobile.
*   Individual profile creation and customization.
*   Videos built into the website where you can learn entrepreneur tips.
*   A discussion board where you can discuss learning material on the website AND do general entrepreneurial things (networking, advice-sharing, etc).
*   Handing in files (deliverables) 
*   Viewing feedback on those files.
*   The ability to create different types of profiles (entrepreneurs, corporations, investor, service providers, admin)

**Out of Scope:**



*   Native mobile app.
*   Microservices and load balancers for high scalability.
*   Any E-commerce functionality on the website.

**Participants**: 



*   Ethan Lam	
*   Jan Garong	
*   Michael Sheinman Orenstrakh	
*   Akira Siddharth Takaki	
*   Maryam Gohargani	
*   Catherine Xia	
*   Hai Yang Tang	

**Note**: We were not able to find time to schedule this meeting with the product team due to the short notice (Tuesday in lecture) and lack of available time slot. We emailed Efosa with these documents, and he was okay with this. Moving forwards, we will run the sprint planning meetings with a member of the product team.
