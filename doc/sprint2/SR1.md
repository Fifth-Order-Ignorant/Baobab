# **Sprint 1 Retrospective Meeting**

**Meeting Participants**: 



* Ethan Lam
* Jan Garong
* Michael Sheinman Orenstrakh
* Akira Siddharth Takaki
* Maryam Gohargani
* Catherine Xia
* Hai Yang Tang	

**Practices that we should continue**:



* Team members are available and responsive.
* Teammates use a personal Discord server for communications.
* Meetings are productive and stay on track.

**New practices for next sprint**:



* Make sure that less blocking happens: tasks should be distributed across the sprint. 
* Use the critical path method to plan the task distributions. 
* Assign deadlines for when a task should be completed.
* Make user-stories independent and achievable within the team capacity for the sprint.
* Generate and assign tasks such that people won’t be blocked for more than 2 days after the sprint starts.

**Harmful practices to stop**:



* Scheduling too difficult user stories. 
* Finishing the work at the last minute. 
* Giving one person all the blocking tasks.
* Frontend people being blocked by backend people or vice versa.  
* Ignoring other responsibilities to get work done for this course.

**Best Experiences**:



* Got a high mark.
* Completed all features.
* Bonded and became better friends.

**Worst Experiences**:



* Most members worked 40+ hours for sprint 1.
* Many members were sleep deprived due to the high workload.
* We had to ignore too many other responsibilities for this sprint.
